# BBGame114
## Breadboard Game 11x4

BBGame114 is handheld game device that consists of an Arduino Nano processor board, an 11x4 LED matrix display, three input buttons and a piezoelectric speaker. This device can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. This GitHub repository contains the BBGame114Lib library that can be used for programming this device, and it also contains a Space Invaders-like game.

## How to Build

Building this breadboard game will take several hours, and this will vary based on the experience you have with basic electronics. 
The links below give an overview of this project and 3 sets of slides that are used for three days in a coding/electronics class for high 
school students.

## How to Teach

* Plan three days of 6 hours, or an equivalent or appropriate amount of time to teach
* Plan on additional instructors, on the order of one instructor per 3 to 5 students
* Purchase sufficient electronics parts for all students, all instructors and also for some spare kits
* Prepare each student's kit of parts beforehand so that this does not take up class time
* Additional instructors should build the circuit once before the class and also try out the coding exercises

## BBGame114 Arduino Library

The [BBGame114Lib.zip](https://github.com/mtejada11/BBGame114/blob/master/Lib/BBGame114Lib.zip?raw=true) library for Arduino included in this repository is a library that allows the BBGame114 device to be programmed with higher level methods/functions than the Arduino `digitalWrite` and `digitalRead` functions. See the page [BBGame114Lib Library Reference](https://github.com/mtejada11/BBGame114/wiki/BBGame114Lib-Library-Reference) page for more information on this library. 

## BBGame114 Coding Exercises

This repository contains several coding exercises. Exercises Ex01 to Ex03b are introductory Arduino exercises that do not required the LED matrix to be assembled. Exercises Ex04 to Ex07b are exercises than can be done with a partially assembled LED matrix of 5x4 pixels. The remaining exercises require the fully assembled BBGame114 circuit with and LED matrix of 11x4 pixels.
